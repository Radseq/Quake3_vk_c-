// tr_font.c
//
//
// The font system uses FreeType 2.x to render TrueType fonts for use within the game.
// As of this writing ( Nov, 2000 ) Team Arena uses these fonts for all of the ui and
// about 90% of the cgame presentation. A few areas of the CGAME were left uses the old
// fonts since the code is shared with standard Q3A.
//
// If you include this font rendering code in a commercial product you MUST include the
// following somewhere with your product, see www.freetype.org for specifics or changes.
// The Freetype code also uses some hinting techniques that MIGHT infringe on patents
// held by apple so be aware of that also.
//
// As of Q3A 1.25+ and Team Arena, we are shipping the game with the font rendering code
// disabled. This removes any potential patent issues and it keeps us from having to
// distribute an actual TrueTrype font which is 1. expensive to do and 2. seems to require
// an act of god to accomplish.
//
// What we did was pre-render the fonts using FreeType ( which is why we leave the FreeType
// credit in the credits ) and then saved off the glyph data and then hand touched up the
// font bitmaps so they scale a bit better in GL.
//
// There are limitations in the way fonts are saved and reloaded in that it is based on
// point size and not name. So if you pre-render Helvetica in 18 point and Impact in 18 point
// you will end up with a single 18 point data file and image set. Typically you will want to
// choose 3 sizes to best approximate the scaling you will be doing in the ui scripting system
//
// In the UI Scripting code, a scale of 1.0 is equal to a 48 point font. In Team Arena, we
// use three or four scales, most of them exactly equaling the specific rendered size. We
// rendered three sizes in Team Arena, 12, 16, and 20.
//
// To generate new font data you need to go through the following steps.
// 1. delete the fontImage_x_xx.tga files and fontImage_xx.dat files from the fonts path.
// 2. in a ui script, specificy a font, smallFont, and bigFont keyword with font name and
//    point size. the original TrueType fonts must exist in fonts at this point.
// 3. run the game, you should see things normally.
// 4. Exit the game and there will be three dat files and at least three tga files. The
//    tga's are in 256x256 pages so if it takes three images to render a 24 point font you
//    will end up with fontImage_0_24.tga through fontImage_2_24.tga
// 5. In future runs of the game, the system looks for these images and data files when a
//    specific point sized font is rendered and loads them for use.
// 6. Because of the original beta nature of the FreeType code you will probably want to hand
//    touch the font bitmaps.
//
// Currently a define in the project turns on or off the FreeType code which is currently
// defined out. To pre-render new fonts you need enable the define ( BUILD_FREETYPE ) and
// uncheck the exclude from build check box in the FreeType2 area of the Renderer project.
